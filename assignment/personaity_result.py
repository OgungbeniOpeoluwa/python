        print("""INTJ Architect An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging 
       personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and 
       rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one. Summary of Architect 
       Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom 
       and other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own 
       discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk 
       disapproval – in fact, they rather enjoy it. Architects aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy.They tend to 
       prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right 
       than popular. Architects can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists.They believe 
       that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. WEAKNESS 
       Architects might be knowledgeable, but they’re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful 
       input from other people – especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. For Architects, 
       rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to 
       admit. Architects can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, 
       ignoring emotion is its own type of bias – one that can cloud Architects’ judgment. Architects hate blindly 
       following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose 
       them. People with this personality type can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations – but 
       sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters. CONCLUSION: Armed with powerful 
       intellects and strategic minds, Architect (INTJ) personalities can outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable 
       to most. But Architects’ strengths, when misunderstood, can turn into weaknesses – and keep them from reaching 
       their full potential.""")

        print("""INTP LOGICIAN A Logician (INTP) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, 
        and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many 
        aspects of life.They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity 
        LOGICIAN SUMMARY * The Life of the Mind Logicians often lose themselves in thought – which isn’t necessarily 
        a bad thing. People with this personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, 
        their minds buzz with ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting 
        full-fledged debates in their own heads.. * Mysteries of the Universe People with this personality type want 
        to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. As 
        their name suggests, Logicians feel most at home in the realm of logic and rationality. As a result, 
        they can find themselves baffled by the illogical, irrational ways that feelings and emotions influence 
        people’s behavior – including their own. WEAKNESS Disconnected – Logicians can get lost in their own train of 
        thought, even when they’re with other people. When these personalities finally resurface with something to 
        say, they may find that the conversation has moved on without them. This can cause them to feel disconnected 
        from other people, especially in large social gatherings. Insensitive – People with this personality type see 
        rationality as the key to a better, happier world. At times, they may underestimate the importance of such 
        irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. As a result, they may inadvertently come 
        across as insensitive or unkind, even though their intentions are generally good. Dissatisfied – Logicians 
        can’t help but imagine how things could be better than they already are. These personalities are constantly 
        on the lookout for problems to solve, topics to learn, and new ways to approach things. Taken too far, 
        this mindset can become overwhelming, with Logicians constantly trying to reinvent the wheel rather than 
        reliably addressing their needs and responsibilities. Impatient – Logicians take pride in their knowledge and 
        in sharing their ideas. When it comes to explaining their rationale, however, they aren’t always patient. If 
        their conversation partner doesn’t follow along or seem sufficiently interested, Logicians may give up with a 
        dismissive “never mind. Perfectionistic – Logicians want to get things done, but their quest for perfection 
        can get in the way. At times, these personalities may get so lost in analyzing various options that they 
        never reach a decision. They may also give up on projects that don’t match the ideal vision in their mind.""")

        print("""ENTJ COMMANDER A Commander (ENTJ) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging 
        personality traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to 
        construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them. Commanders are 
        natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, 
        and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also 
        characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to 
        achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. COMMANDER SUMMARY *Striving for Greatness If there’s 
        anything Commanders love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time 
        and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type 
        brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing 
        each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This 
        determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer 
        willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to 
        push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.motional expression 
        isn’t the strong suit of any Analyst type, but Commanders’ distance from their emotions is especially public, 
        and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. WEAKNESS: * Stubborn and Dominant – Sometimes all this 
        confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, 
        trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone. * Intolerant – People with the 
        Commander personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, 
        and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. Commanders won’t hesitate a second to make that 
        fact clear to those around them. * Impatient – Some people need more time to think than others, 
        an intolerable delay to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or 
        disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make. *  Arrogant – Commander personalities 
        respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don’t match up. 
        This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own 
        right, but will seem so beside overbearing Commanders. * Poor Handling of Emotions – All this bluster, 
        alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant from their own emotional expression 
        and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ 
        feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations. * 
        Cold and Ruthless – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, 
        especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing 
        personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant """)
