       personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and 
       rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one. Summary of Architect 
       Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom 
       and other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own 
       discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk 
       disapproval – in fact, they rather enjoy it. Architects aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy.They tend to 
       prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right 
       than popular. Architects can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists.They believe 
       that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. WEAKNESS 
       Architects might be knowledgeable, but they’re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful 
       input from other people – especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. For Architects, 
       rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to 
       admit. Architects can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, 
       ignoring emotion is its own type of bias – one that can cloud Architects’ judgment. Architects hate blindly 
       following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose 
       them. People with this personality type can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations – but 
       sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters. CONCLUSION: Armed with powerful 
       intellects and strategic minds, Architect (INTJ) personalities can outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable 
       to most. But Architects’ strengths, when misunderstood, can turn into weaknesses – and keep them from reaching 
       their full potential.""")

        and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many 
        aspects of life.They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity 
        LOGICIAN SUMMARY * The Life of the Mind Logicians often lose themselves in thought – which isn’t necessarily 
        a bad thing. People with this personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, 
        their minds buzz with ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting 
        full-fledged debates in their own heads.. * Mysteries of the Universe People with this personality type want 
        to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. As 
        their name suggests, Logicians feel most at home in the realm of logic and rationality. As a result, 
        they can find themselves baffled by the illogical, irrational ways that feelings and emotions influence 
        people’s behavior – including their own. WEAKNESS Disconnected – Logicians can get lost in their own train of 
        thought, even when they’re with other people. When these personalities finally resurface with something to 
        say, they may find that the conversation has moved on without them. This can cause them to feel disconnected 
        from other people, especially in large social gatherings. Insensitive – People with this personality type see 
        rationality as the key to a better, happier world. At times, they may underestimate the importance of such 
        irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. As a result, they may inadvertently come 
        across as insensitive or unkind, even though their intentions are generally good. Dissatisfied – Logicians 
        can’t help but imagine how things could be better than they already are. These personalities are constantly 
        on the lookout for problems to solve, topics to learn, and new ways to approach things. Taken too far, 
        this mindset can become overwhelming, with Logicians constantly trying to reinvent the wheel rather than 
        reliably addressing their needs and responsibilities. Impatient – Logicians take pride in their knowledge and 
        in sharing their ideas. When it comes to explaining their rationale, however, they aren’t always patient. If 
        their conversation partner doesn’t follow along or seem sufficiently interested, Logicians may give up with a 
        dismissive “never mind. Perfectionistic – Logicians want to get things done, but their quest for perfection 
        can get in the way. At times, these personalities may get so lost in analyzing various options that they 
        never reach a decision. They may also give up on projects that don’t match the ideal vision in their mind.""")

        personality traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to 
        construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them. Commanders are 
        natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, 
        and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also 
        characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to 
        achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. COMMANDER SUMMARY *Striving for Greatness If there’s 
        anything Commanders love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time 
        and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type 
        brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing 
        each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This 
        determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer 
        willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to 
        push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.motional expression 
        isn’t the strong suit of any Analyst type, but Commanders’ distance from their emotions is especially public, 
        and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. WEAKNESS: * Stubborn and Dominant – Sometimes all this 
        confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, 
        trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone. * Intolerant – People with the 
        Commander personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, 
        and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. Commanders won’t hesitate a second to make that 
        fact clear to those around them. * Impatient – Some people need more time to think than others, 
        an intolerable delay to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or 
        disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make. *  Arrogant – Commander personalities 
        respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don’t match up. 
        This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own 
        right, but will seem so beside overbearing Commanders. * Poor Handling of Emotions – All this bluster, 
        alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant from their own emotional expression 
        and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ 
        feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations. * 
        Cold and Ruthless – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, 
        especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing 
        personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant """)

        print("""ENTP DEBATER A Debater (ENTP) is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting 
        personality traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental 
        agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter. Quick-witted and 
        audacious, Debaters aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree 
        with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up people with this personality type more than a bit of 
        verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better. DEBATER 
        SUMMARY Breaking the Rules Debaters are known for their rebellious streak. For this personality type, 
        no belief is too sacred to be questioned, no idea is too fundamental to be scrutinized, and no rule is too 
        important to be broken, or at least thoroughly tested. Sometimes Debaters even rebel against their own 
        beliefs by arguing the opposing viewpoint – just to see how the world looks from the other side.As Debaters 
        see it, most people are too ready to do as they’re told and blindly conform to social norms, pressures, 
        and standards.Debaters enjoy the mental exercise of questioning the prevailing mode of thought, and they take 
        a certain pleasure in uncovering the value of underdogs and outliers. Their active minds can’t help but 
        rethink the things that everyone else takes for granted and push them in clever new directions. While Debater 
        personalities love to brainstorm and think big, they tend to avoid getting caught doing the “grunt work” of 
        implementing their ideas. The Cost of Contrarianism Debaters’ capacity for debate is legendary, 
        but that doesn’t mean that it’s always helpful. When they openly question their boss in a meeting or pick 
        apart everything their significant other says, Debaters may think that they’re being champions of rationality 
        and logic. But they may also be doing their chances of success and happiness more harm than good. WEAKNESS * 
        Very Argumentative – If there’s anything Debaters enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea, 
        and nothing is sacred. * Insensitive – Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push 
        their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. * Intolerant – Unless people are able to back up their 
        ideas in a round of mental sparring, Debaters are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people 
        themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it’s not worth bothering with. * Can 
        Find It Difficult to Focus – The same flexibility that allows Debaters to come up with such original plans 
        and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial 
        excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for Debaters, and fresh thoughts are 
        the solution, though not always a helpful one. * Dislike Practical Matters – Debaters are interested in what 
        could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard 
        details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn’t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, 
        Debater personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day. 
        CONCLUSION Armed with a powerful intellect and vivid imagination, Debaters can overcome or outmaneuver 
        obstacles that seem unbeatable to most.""")

        print("""INFJ ADVOCATE An Advocate (INFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging 
        personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, 
        personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things. Advocates (INFJs) may 
        be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and 
        principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For 
        Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, 
        helping others, and being a force for good in the world. While they have lofty goals and ambitions, 
        Advocates shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, 
        and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. ADVOCATE SUMMARY Seeking Purpose 
        Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, Advocates tend to carry around a sense – whether 
        conscious or not – of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep, 
        abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in with those around them. This isn’t to say 
        that Advocates can’t enjoy social acceptance or close relationships – only that they sometimes feel 
        misunderstood or at odds with the world.Fortunately, this sense of being out of step doesn’t diminish 
        Advocates’ commitment to making the world a better place. Advocates are troubled by injustice, 
        and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain.They often feel called to use their strengths 
        – including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity – to uplift others and spread compassion WEAAKNESS * 
        Sensitive to Criticism – Advocates aren’t averse to feedback – that is, unless they believe that someone is 
        challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to 
        them, people with this personality type can become defensive or dismissive. * Reluctant to Open Up – 
        Advocates value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and 
        be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, 
        when Advocates don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their 
        relationships. * Perfectionistic – The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this 
        is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. Advocates 
        might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually 
        fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better. * Avoiding the 
        Ordinary – Advocates yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it’s hard to achieve anything 
        extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into 
        everyday routines and to-do lists, Advocates may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality. * Prone 
        to Burnout – Advocates’ perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People 
        with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with 
        necessary self-care and rest.""")

        and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, 
        and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do. Although they may seem 
        quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, 
        they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. 
        These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to 
        music, art, nature, and the people around them. Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, 
        soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a 
        small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that 
        doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique. MEDITATOR SUMMARY * Speaking Their Truth Few 
        things make Mediators more uneasy than pretending to be someone they aren’t. With their sensitivity and their 
        commitment to authenticity, people with this personality type tend to crave opportunities for creative 
        self-expression. Mediators can explore their own inner nature as well as their place in the world. While this 
        is a beautiful trait, these personalities sometimes show a tendency to daydream and fantasize rather than 
        take action. To avoid feeling frustrated, unfulfilled, or incapable, Mediators need to make sure that they 
        take steps to turn their dreams and ideas into reality. In Search of a Calling People with this personality 
        type tend to feel directionless or stuck until they connect with a sense of purpose for their lives. For many 
        Mediators, this purpose has something to do with uplifting others and their ability to feel other people’s 
        suffering as if it were their own. While Mediators want to help everyone, they need to focus their energy and 
        efforts – otherwise, they can end up exhausted. WEAKNESS * Unrealistic – Nothing in this world is perfect – 
        and that can be a difficult truth for Mediators to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless 
        romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set Mediators up for 
        disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams. * Self-Isolating – Mediators long to 
        connect with others, but they don’t always know how. Especially in new environments, Mediators may be 
        reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a 
        new community. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated. * 
        Unfocused – Mediators’ imaginative, introspective nature doesn’t always lend itself to productivity. Many 
        Mediators get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isn’t 
        that they are incapable – rather, it’s that they run into problems when they become so caught up in different 
        ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action. * Emotionally Vulnerable – The emotional 
        attunement of these personalities is among their greatest strengths. But unless Mediators establish 
        boundaries, they can be at risk of absorbing other people’s negative moods or attitudes. * Desperate to 
        Please – Conflict tends to be stressful for Mediators, who yearn for harmony and acceptance. When someone 
        dislikes or disapproves of them, these personalities may become fixated on trying to clear the air and change 
        that person’s mind. Unfortunately, Mediators’ desire to please others can drain their energy, eclipsing their 
        inner wisdom and their awareness of their own needs. * Self-Critical – Mediators believe in their unique 
        potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic 
        expectations for themselves. When Mediators fail to live up to these visions, they may accuse themselves of 
        being useless or selfish or woefully inadequate. Taken too far, this self-criticism can discourage Mediators, 
        leading them to give up on even their dearest dreams. CONCLUSION Few personality types are as poetic and 
        kindhearted as Mediators (INFPs). With their unique gifts, Mediators can overcome all sorts of challenges and 
        obstacles and brighten the lives of those around them in the process.""")

        strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals. 
        Protagonists (ENFJs) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, 
        these personality types strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They 
        rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy. Protagonists 
        are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, 
        coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but 
        in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring Protagonists a deeper sense of 
        joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves. POTAGONIST SUMMARY 
        Protagonists tend to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism. When something strikes 
        them as unjust or wrong, they speak up. But they rarely come across as brash or pushy, as their sensitivity 
        and insight guide them to speak in ways that resonate with others. These personality types have an uncanny 
        ability to pick up on people’s underlying motivations and beliefs. At times, they may not even understand how 
        they come to grasp another person’s mind and heart so quickly.These flashes of insight can make Protagonists 
        incredibly persuasive and inspiring communicators.Protagonists’ secret weapon is their purity of intent. * 
        Getting Involved When Protagonists care about someone, they want to help solve that person’s problems – 
        sometimes at any cost. The good news is that many people are grateful for Protagonists’ assistance and 
        advice. After all, there’s a reason that these personalities have a reputation for helping others improve 
        their lives.Protagonists are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk. Nothing makes them 
        happier than motivating other people to do what’s right. Protagonists tend to have a clear vision of what 
        people can or should do in order to better themselves, but not everyone is ready to make those changes. If 
        Protagonists push too hard, their loved ones may feel resentful or unfairly judged. And while this 
        personality type is known for being insightful, even the wisest Protagonists may sometimes misread a 
        situation or unwittingly give bad advice. * Leading the Way People with this personality type are devoted 
        altruists, ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand up for the people and ideas that they believe 
        in. This strength of conviction bolsters Protagonists’ innate leadership skills, particularly their ability 
        to guide people to work together in service of the greater good. WEAKNESS * Unrealistic – Many Protagonists 
        put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. * Overly Idealistic – Protagonists tend 
        to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. * Condescending – People with this personality type 
        enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, 
        Protagonists’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy 
        for persuading other people, unfortunately. * Intense – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are 
        rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. 
        * Overly Empathetic – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a 
        tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and 
        physically exhausted. CONCLUSION Protagonists’ gifts include idealism, determination, and the ability to 
        envision a better future – but they don’t just want to hear what makes them great. Protagonists are committed 
        to actually using these gifts to serve a greater purpose. """)

        comfortable opening up. People with this personality type need to be careful, however. Campaigners’ intuition 
        may lead them to read far too much into other people’s actions and behaviors. Instead of simply asking for an 
        explanation, Campaigners may end up puzzling over someone else’s desires or intentions. This kind of social 
        stress is what keeps harmony-focused Campaigners awake at night. Campaigners will spend a lot of time 
        exploring different relationships, feelings, and ideas before they find a path for their lives that feels 
        right. But when they finally do find their way, their imagination, empathy, and courage can light up not only

        clear hierarchies and expectations. People with the Logistician personality type rarely hesitate to take 
        responsibility for their actions and choices. Generally speaking, they are quick to own up to their own 
        mistakes, admitting the truth even if it doesn’t make them look good. Because they strive to meet their 
        obligations no matter what, Logistician personalities are often baffled by people who fail to hold themselves 
        to the same standard. At times, Logisticians might unfairly misjudge people who can’t match their rigorous 
        self-control – suspecting that someone is being lazy or dishonest when that person might actually be coping 
        with other challenges.Even if Logisticians don’t speak these judgments aloud, their disdain can come through 
        regardless, earning them a reputation for being somewhat strict or unempathetic. * Picking Up the Slack 
        Logisticians’ dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. But it can 
        also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With their strong work ethic and sense of duty, 
        Logisticians may routinely find themselves shouldering other people’s responsibilities. Even if they don’t 
        complain about the situation, Logisticians can end up exhausted or discouraged if they’re constantly expected 
        – or taking it upon themselves – to pick up the slack for their colleagues, friends, or loved ones. 
        CONCLUSION Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as Logisticians. Known for their reliability 
        and hard work, Logisticians are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for 
        themselves and their loved ones. Logisticians’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own 
        personal growth.""")

        personality traits. These people tend to be warm and unassuming in their own steady way. They’re efficient 
        and responsible, giving careful attention to practical details in their daily lives. Defenders can be counted 
        on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved 
        ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring 
        instead to operate behind the scenes. Defenders also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for 
        detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social 
        relationships. Defenders are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even 
        the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives. DEFENDER SUMMARY * The Gift of Loyalty Among Defenders’ most 
        distinctive traits is loyalty. Rare is the Defender who allows a friendship or relationship to fade away from 
        lack of effort.People with this personality type are known for dropping everything and lending a hand 
        whenever a friend or family member is going through a hard time. Other people may take advantage of 
        Defenders’ helpful, hardworking nature, leaving them feeling burned out and overworked. And Defenders may 
        feel guilty or stressed when they contemplate changes – even necessary changes – to themselves, 
        their relationships, or the way they’ve done things in the past. Defenders may find themselves quietly losing 
        their enthusiasm and motivation, eventually becoming resentful toward the people who just don’t seem to 
        appreciate them. Although they’re Introverted, Defenders have a deeply social nature. Thanks to their ability 
        to remember the details of other people’s lives, Defenders have a special talent for making their friends and 
        acquaintances feel seen, known, and cherished. Few personality types can match Defenders’ ability to choose 
        just the right gift for any occasion, whether large or small. CONCLUSION Defenders’ gifts include generosity, 
        patience, and determination – but they aren’t people who just want to hear what makes them great. Defenders

        personality traits. They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They 
        often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity. Executives are 
        representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially 
        acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and 
        dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, 
        and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often 
        take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished 
        local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together. EXECUTIVE 
        SUMMARY Executives are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts – the 
        surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push 
        an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren’t just empty talk either, 
        as Executives are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and 
        sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable. However, 
        Executives don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated – people 
        with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates jeopardize them through 
        incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their wrath. This can earn 
        them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities, but it’s not because 
        Executives are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society 
        work. A Greater Responsibility The main challenge for Executives is to recognize that not everyone follows 
        the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual, 
        as well as that of the group, and helps bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. That way, Executives 
        really do have all the facts, and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone. 
        CONCLUSION Few personality types are as practical and strong-willed as Executives. Known for their 
        reliability and administrative skills, Executives are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable 
        environment for themselves and their loved ones. Executives’ dedication is invaluable in many areas,

        community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others. 
        Consuls do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to 
        those around them. Generous and reliable, people with this personality type often take it upon themselves – 
        in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together. CONSUL SUMMARY * The 
        Beauty of a Responsible Life Consuls are altruists. They take seriously their responsibilities to give back, 
        serve others, and do the right thing. And Consuls believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly 
        every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, Consuls may 
        find it difficult not to judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, 
        Consuls often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with 
        them. Consuls have a clear moral compass – and it can be nothing short of baffling to them when other 
        people’s actions don’t align with it. Building Relationships That Last Supportive and outgoing, Consuls can 
        always be spotted at a party – they’re the ones fluttering around making sure that everyone else is having a 
        good time! But make no mistake: Consuls don’t just breeze through other people’s lives. Loyal to the core, 
        they build lasting relationships, and they can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand – or a 
        listening ear – is needed. For many people with the Consul personality type, one of life’s greatest 
        challenges is accepting that they can’t control anyone else’s thoughts or behavior – not even those who are 
        nearest and dearest to them. Fortunately, Consuls can find peace and fulfillment by focusing on what they do 
        best: setting an example of care, consideration, and responsibility – and bringing people together in the 
        process. CONCLUSION: Few personality types are as practical and caring as Consuls. Known for their social and 
        administrative skills, Consuls are good at creating and maintaining a secure, stable and friendly environment 
        for themselves and their loved ones. Consuls’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own 
        personal growth. Yet Consuls can be easily tripped up in areas where their kindness and practical approach 
        are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or 
        improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, Consuls need to put in

        print("""ISTP VIRTUOSO A Virtuoso (ISTP) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, 
        and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without 
        needing much external connection. They engage in life with inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their 
        approach as needed. Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the 
        world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural 
        Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, 
        and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy 
        than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit 
        better than they were before. Virtuosos explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and 
        first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t 
        even mind them getting into their space. Virtuosos enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, 
        especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five 
        percent of the population. Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society 
        tends to expect can be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age. VIRTU0SO SUMMARY * 
        Dare to Differ While their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, Virtuosos are 
        actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but 
        unable to stay focused on formal studies, Virtuoso personalities can be a challenge to predict, even by their 
        friends and loved ones. Virtuosos can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a 
        store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions. 
        Virtuosos’ decisions stem from a sense of practical realism, and at their heart is a strong sense of direct 
        fairness, a “do unto others” attitude, which really helps to explain many of Virtuosos’ puzzling traits. 
        Instead of being overly cautious though, avoiding stepping on toes in order to avoid having their toes 
        stepped on, Virtuosos are likely to go too far, accepting likewise retaliation, good or bad, as fair play. 
        The biggest issue Virtuosos are likely to face is that they often act too soon, taking for granted their 
        permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. They’ll be the first to tell an insensitive joke, 
        get overly involved in someone else’s project, roughhouse and play around, or suddenly change their plans 
        because something more interesting came up. * Defying the Rules Virtuosos will come to learn that many other 
        personality types have much more firmly drawn lines on rules and acceptable behavior than they do – they 
        don’t want to hear an insensitive joke, and certainly wouldn’t tell one back, and they wouldn’t want to 
        engage in horseplay, even with a willing party. If a situation is already emotionally charged, 
        violating these boundaries can backfire tremendously. Virtuosos have a particular difficulty in predicting 
        emotions, but this is just a natural extension of their fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge 
        Virtuosos’ emotions and motivations. However, their tendency to explore their relationships through their 
        actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. People with the Virtuoso 
        personality type struggle with boundaries and guidelines, preferring the freedom to move about and color 
        outside the lines if they need to. Finding an environment where they can work with good friends who 
        understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach 
        to build practical solutions and things, will give Virtuosos many happy years of building useful boxes – and 
        admiring them from the outside. CONCLUSION Few personality types are as bold and practical as Virtuosos. 
        Known for their technical mastery and willingness to improvise, Virtuosos are good at finding unique 
        solutions to seemingly impossible challenges. Virtuosos’ desire to explore and learn new things is invaluable 
        in many areas, including their own personal growth. """)

        and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, 
        and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials. 
        Adventurers are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For this personality type, 
        life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, 
        Adventurers act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals. And every Adventurer is 
        certainly unique. Driven by curiosity and eager to try new things, people with this personality often have a 
        fascinating array of passions and interests. With their exploratory spirits and their ability to find joy in 
        everyday life, Adventurers can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. The only irony? 
        Unassuming and humble, Adventurers tend to see themselves as “just doing their own thing,” so they may not 
        even realize how remarkable they really are. ADVENTURER SUMMARY * The beauty of an open mind Adventurers take 
        each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of 
        room in their lives for the unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of 
        spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves or with their loved ones.This 
        flexible mindset makes Adventurers remarkably tolerant and open-minded. * Living in Harmony In their 
        relationships, Adventurers are warm, friendly, and caring, taking wholehearted enjoyment in the company of 
        their nearest and dearest. But make no mistake: this is an Introverted personality type, meaning that 
        Adventurers need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing with others. This alone time 
        is what allows Adventurers to reestablish a sense of their own identity – in other words, to reconnect with 
        who they truly are. Creative and free-spirited, Adventurers march to the beat of their own drum, and it would 
        be easy to assume that they don’t particularly worry what other people think of them. But this isn’t the case 
        – Adventurers are thoughtful and perceptive, able to pick up on people’s unspoken feelings and opinions, 
        and it can upset them if they don’t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated. When faced with criticism, 
        it can be a challenge for people with this personality type not to get caught up in the heat of the moment. 
        If they encounter harsh or seemingly unfair criticism, they may even lose their tempers in spectacular 
        fashion. CONCLUSION Few personality types are as colorful and charming as Adventurers. Known for their 
        kindness and artistic skills, Adventurers are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. 
        Adventurers’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal

        is in front of them. They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more 
        personal pursuits. Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot 
        them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to 
        group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities love to be the 
        center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer – or volunteer 
        a shy friend. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting 
        idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses. ENTREPRENEUR SUMMARY * Diving Right In Entrepreneurs are 
        the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into 
        the action – they are the eye of the storm. People with the Entrepreneur personality type enjoy drama, 
        passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it’s so stimulating to their logical minds. 
        They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire 
        rational stimulus response. Also challenging is that to Entrepreneurs, it makes more sense to use their own 
        moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school 
        instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and can earn Entrepreneur personalities a certain 
        reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring 
        stuff, Entrepreneurs are a force to be reckoned with. * The Path Less Traveled With perhaps the most 
        perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, Entrepreneurs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether 
        a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this personality type pick 
        up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. 
        Entrepreneurs use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions, often with 
        little regard for sensitivity. Entrepreneurs should remember that not everyone wants their secrets and 
        decisions broadcast. If Entrepreneurs aren’t careful though, they may get too caught in the moment, 
        take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive people, or forget to take care of their own health 
        and safety. Making up only four percent of the population, there are just enough Entrepreneurs out there to 
        keep things spicy and competitive, and not so many as to cause a systemic risk. CONCLUSION Few personality 
        types are as charming and attractive as Entrepreneurs. Known for their ability to improvise and focus 
        completely on the present, Entrepreneurs are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience.

        taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared 
        activities. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that 
        way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as Entertainers when it comes 
        to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style. ENTERTAINER 
        SUMMARY Living with Passion Entertainers love the spotlight, and all the world’s a stage. Many famous people 
        with the Entertainer personality type are indeed actors, but they love putting on a show for their friends 
        too, chatting with a unique and earthy wit, soaking up attention and making every outing feel a bit like a 
        party. Utterly social, Entertainers enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just 
        having fun with a good group of friends. Entertainers have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality 
        type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, Entertainer personalities have an eye for fashion. 
        Knowing what’s attractive the moment they see it, Entertainers aren’t afraid to change their surroundings to 
        reflect their personal style. Entertainers are naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease. 
        Entertainers usually love a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the 
        criticisms it can bring. * A Spontaneous Spirit The biggest challenge Entertainers face is that they are 
        often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those 
        luxuries possible. Complex analysis, repetitive tasks, and matching statistics to real consequences are not 
        easy activities for Entertainers. They’d rather rely on luck or opportunity, or simply ask for help from 
        their extensive circle of friends. It is important for Entertainers to challenge themselves to keep track of 
        long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake – there won’t always be someone else around who 
        can help to keep an eye on these things. There’s nothing that makes Entertainers feel quite as unhappy as 
        realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends. CONCLUSION Few personality 
        types are as charming and attractive as Entertainers. Known for their ability to improvise and focus 
        completely on the present, Entertainers are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. 
        Entertainers’ energy, enthusiasm and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own
